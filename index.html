            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>As a freelance web developer, I thrive on creativity and exploration. I love experimenting with different
                technologies and approaches to find the perfect solution for each unique project. Crafting pixel-perfect
                designs isn't just a goal—it's a passion. I believe every detail matters, and I strive to deliver
                visually stunning websites that resonate with users. Accessibility is at the heart of my work; I aim to
                create inclusive experiences that welcome everyone, regardless of their abilities. Whether it's pushing
                boundaries or refining the smallest details, I’m dedicated to bringing ideas to life through thoughtful,
                innovative web development.
